        Student Stress Level Classifier
    </a>
</h4>
<h5>Using a dataset from <a href ="https://github.com/drewgiffin/student-stress-level-classifier">Kaggle</a>, I developed a machine learning project to better understand how studentsâ€™ daily activities relate to their stress. Features such as time spent studying, sleeping, socializing, exercising, participating in extracurricular activities, and academic indicators like GPA were analyzed to train a model capable of predicting a student's stress level.</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        Created visualizations such as histograms, box plots, correlation heatmaps, and scatter plot matrices to represent data relationships.
    </li>
    <li>
        Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the features before training.
    </li>
    <li>
        Preprocessed the data by removing outliers, handling missing values, eliminating duplicates, and normalizing for model training.
    </li>
    <li>
        Trained a logistic regression model to predict student stress levels.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reported a confusion matrix and classification metrics to evaluate model accuracy and identify areas for improvement.
